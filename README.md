# XertroVerrider

XertroV makes some plugins that require manual review before they work on a new game version. This is smart, but it could be annoying if you feel comfortable taking risks. This plugin allows you to override those checks, along with the ability to remember those choices when the game or those plugins update.

Currently supported plugins:

- Auto-hide Opponents
- Editor++
- Ghosts++
